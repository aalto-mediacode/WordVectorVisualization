A visualizer using the ofxWord2Vec addon in Openframeworks. It allows you to type words on screen, then perform calculations on the word vectors and display the resulting vectors.

Note:
The system is very prone to errors. A misplaced space or a typo will result in a crash.


Installation:
You can find the addon by perevalovds here: http://github.com/perevalovds/ofxWord2Vec .
The visualizer uses the small Wikipedia dump file that is provided with the addon, but should work with any compatible embeddings file. 
Openframeworks: http://openframeworks.cc/download/ .
